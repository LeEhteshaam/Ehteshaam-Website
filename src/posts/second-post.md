# Story
*Batman: Caped Crusader* introduces an inexperienced Batman in a post-WWII Gotham landscape where he builds relationships with James and Barbara Gordon and meets many villains from his rogues' gallery. With the city filled with corruption, Batman and his allies dive head-on, tackling the evil residing within the city. Upon first glance, I reflected on the entirety of Batman media and noticed a trend in recent years: *young Batman is in fashion*, marking a resurgence in Batman stories. Despite the fact that Frank Miller's *Batman: Year One* and *The Long Halloween* by Jeph Loeb are nearing three and four decades old, respectively, they continue to have a lasting influence on writers today.

A question that really came to mind after watching the show's trailer was, *do we need more young Batman*? *The Long Halloween* and *Batman: Year One*, among many other tales, showcase the characteristics and challenges of a young Bruce Wayne trying to keep Gotham from descending further into chaos. However, I quickly reassessed my skepticism after my initial watch of the series. *Batman: Caped Crusader* is not *Batman: The Animated Series*, a comparison many make to downplay the show, but it is something different.

Matt Reeves' world-building into a noir Gotham City presents a fine distinction in separating itself from its peers. Batman is not portrayed as a high-tech superhero with satellites and supercomputers; instead, he is constrained by the technology of his time. As such, Batman’s detective work involves *going to the library* or using a map to locate potential points of interest. This initially subtle change greatly impacts the story, presenting a more grounded and realistic take on *The Dark Knight*.

Season One contained 10 episodes, with each episode featuring its own villains and slowly building up to a tense finale. By planting seeds in every episode, the show maintains viewers' attention, despite the fact that each episode is slightly isolated from the others. Although this approach is viable most of the time, I often found myself dissatisfied with the conclusions of episodes, viewing them as rushed or occasionally forgetting to add crucial information. For example, in the season opener, we are introduced to the Penguin, and Batman uncovers that she (note that in this show, some gender swaps are made) is a mobster. In order to stop her, he goes on her boat, named The Iceberg Lounge, and confronts her. After she is apprehended, many details are left out, such as *where does she go for punishment*? Perhaps, they could have introduced Arkham Asylum or Blackgate here. Also, *what happened to the National Guard*? Do they discover who Batman is, or do they move on? These questions are left untouched due to the episode length, each being around 20 minutes.

The season one finale centers around the mafia seeking revenge against Harvey Dent, who becomes *Two-Face* and kills those who wronged him. Thematically, this conclusion focuses on Bruce Wayne reflecting on the meaning of Batman. After Harvey Dent is, as usual, sprayed with acid by the mafia, he spends days in isolation—until Bruce Wayne, his friend, decides to take him to a restaurant. This simple, friendly gesture quickly turns tragic, as Harvey’s split personality causes him to freak out and embark on his mission for revenge.

In response to this violent outburst, Alfred questions Bruce’s decisions to act quickly and almost irrationally. Wayne feels he has failed his friend and must suit up to stop him. This raises the question: if Bruce swore to protect the people of Gotham and his loved ones as a response to his parents' death by being Batman, then why couldn’t he help his friend from falling into darkness? It is the mafia’s initial proposal to support Dent financially for his mayoral campaign that pushes him into a life of crime. If Bruce had used his trust fund to help Dent, this might not have happened.

The show's conclusion is reminiscent of *The Dark Knight*, where Bruce acknowledges and is saddened by Harvey Dent’s tragic downfall—from the city’s *White Knight* to a murderer. This conclusion serves as a great starting point for the challenges Bruce will face as Batman.

The mantle of Batman, as seen in *Batman: The Animated Series*, is portrayed as more of a mentally challenging profession than perhaps a physically demanding one. As Batman says, *a weary body can be dealt with, but a weary mind*. This season lays the foundation for the mental obstacles Batman will face, especially with his crazed foe, the Joker, foreshadowed in the finale.

# Characters 

Many characters in the show have undergone a *gender swap* or a *race swap*, which has sparked controversy and criticism. While these changes make some characters look different from their traditional portrayals, I have come to appreciate them. In the vast multiverse of the DC universe, it is entirely plausible to have a lesbian Harley Quinn or a Black Jim Gordon. These changes help diversify the cast and move away from a predominantly white-dominated representation. Another aspect I appreciated in the character designs is the inclusion of varying body types. In many Batman iterations, characters often have exaggerated, Olympian physiques, which can be quite unrealistic. The more diverse body types in *Batman: Caped Crusader* provide a more relatable and grounded depiction of the characters.

The design of costumes is done excellently, lets just have a quick run down of my thoughts on some of the important chracters.
    1. **Batman** dawns a black and grey suit with what appears to be minimal armor and a point cowl similar to his early days in the comics.
    2. **Bruce Wayne** is a well-built giant of a man with vibrant blue eyes and THICK eyelashes.
    3. **Catwomen** design is inspired by *Batman: The Brave and The Bold*, while others adore this style, I am not apart of that group.
    4. **Onomatopoeia** is my most preferred design, with his deadly yet silent nature, his costume reflects and amplifies these characteristics.

Voice acting was done well all-around, with the most important voice, that of Batman, being superbly done Hamish Linklater, although Kevin Conroy's legacy as the Batman can never be topped, I think the future of Batman's voice is in good hands. 

Now to the juicy part—actual character analysis. Although many characters remain true to their traditional portrayals, the changes in *Harley Quinn* and *Harvey Dent* provide excellent examples of when it's beneficial to alter a character and when it might be less effective. I’ve always wondered why one of the world’s greatest psychiatrists, Harley Quinn, is so easily drawn into the Joker’s orbit. Despite his insanity, he essentially creates a second Joker in Harley, which has always bothered me as it seems to undermine her own mental capabilities.

In this show, however, Harley Quinn's intelligence and wit are fully utilized. Instead of being merely a product of the Joker's influence, she adopts the Harley Quinn persona to address and punish those who prey on women. This change not only preserves her intelligence but also provides her with a more purposeful and nuanced role.

Harvey Dent, on the other hand, sometimes behaves in a manner that feels like a complete departure from his usual portrayal. His actions and demeanor contrast sharply with his typical pursuit of justice. This characterization makes it harder for viewers to see him as a tragic figure; instead, his death in the finale might be viewed more as a form of punishment for his actions rather than a tragic downfall. 

He engages in corruption to win cases, interacts with corrupt individuals, and even gambles with a man’s life to advance his campaign. This portrayal deviates significantly from the Harvey Dent I’m accustomed to and prefer. In spire of the show’s attempt to redeem Harvey by having him sacrifice himself to protect Barbara, it’s challenging to forgive a character who casually discusses putting a child in jail for life or giving him the electric chair.

Overall, *Batman: Caped Crusader* is a worthwhile watch for all. While there are some noteworthy flaws, the overall Batman experience is great.
