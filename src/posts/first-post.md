# Story:

Naughty Dog's adventure into the human state in a post-apocalyptic world is simply fascinating. Twenty years after a fungal infection outbreak completely changed the tides of world history, the psychological deterioration of man is inevitable, yet *The Last of Us* still shocked me in my first playthrough. The journey of a father moving past his daughter's demise while fostering a new parental relationship in a chaotic yet breathtaking journey throughout America is crafted in masterful fashion. 

The narrative unfolds across the seasons, beginning in summer and concluding in fall. This deliberate use of seasonal change serves a strong thematic purpose. For instance, winter—often associated with hardship—becomes a pivotal moment in the story where Ellie undergoes a profound transformation, *losing her innocence*. With Joel incapacitated, the roles reverse, placing Ellie in a *protective role*. Winter’s harshness, characterized by cold, scarcity of food, and shorter days, symbolizes the escalating challenges Ellie faces, culminating in her encounter with David, a deranged cannibal who forces her to confront her own morality. These symbolic details demonstrate the immense care and attention poured into the game, leaving a lasting impact on the player.

The characters feel *real* and relatable. Their dialogue doesn’t merely mimic the relationship between a father and daughter or a mentor and mentee—it embodies it. Ellie’s persistent pestering of Joel about their dire situation, or her attempts to lighten the mood with dad jokes, mirrors interactions I recognize from conversations with friends and family. Their beliefs and ideologies are also grounded in their personal experiences. Joel’s initially cynical view of the world is understandable, given that two decades of survival have taught him to prioritize his own needs, even at the expense of others. The game cleverly employs character parallels to illustrate the potential paths the characters might take in this unforgiving world—Joel’s parallel with Bill serves as a warning of what he could become if he continues to shut others out, while David represents a darker potential within Ellie, one that could lead her down a path of harm and moral compromise.

Another significant aspect of *The Last of Us* is how it challenges the characters' morality. Throughout the journey, we leave behind graveyards of both the infected and real people—innocent or guilty—all for the sake of Joel and Ellie's survival. This moral ambiguity reaches its peak when the player encounters David, a man who kills others for food. Here, both Ellie and the player are confronted with a chilling question: *You kill to survive, and so do we*. This statement not only underscores the psychological deterioration of humanity, as previously mentioned, but also forces both the player and Ellie to confront the harsh reality that they are not the *good guys*. This is a crucial theme that is often overlooked in other Naughty Dog games. For instance, in their series *Uncharted*, Nathan Drake and his companions practically massacre entire militias, yet the game makes no comment on this fact. Either the *real* Nathan Drake is different from the one the player controls, or it is canon that Nathan Drake has killed thousands of men, all in the pursuit of treasure that never truly stays with him.

Another intriguing theme the game explores is *what you would do to save the people you love*. Ellie is unique in that she is immune to the fungal infection that turns humans into zombies, and the game's objective is to bring her to the Fireflies, a rebellious faction hoping for a *Hail Mary* by creating a vaccine. However, when Joel brings Ellie to their headquarters, a turn of events causes Ellie to pass out, and when Joel awakens, he is informed that she is being prepped for surgery. The problem is that the fungal infection grows in the brain, so extracting the necessary information to develop a potential vaccine would require sacrificing Ellie. Joel does not take this lightly; he has already failed to protect his first daughter, a loss he has spent 20 years trying to overcome, and he is not willing to lose his second daughter as well. So, Joel, in true *Rambo* fashion, kills nearly everyone in the hospital to save Ellie. Now, if we look at this situation purely logically, the answer seems straightforward: sacrifice the few to save the many. But when you consider sacrificing your closest companion in the world for the mere chance of creating a vaccine, the dilemma becomes far more complex.

Should we sacrifice our loved ones to save a world where 20 years of trauma have twisted humanity into a state where the lives of others are easily disregarded? Is it truly worth creating a vaccine in a world where people like David prey upon others? These are the thought-provoking questions that *The Last of Us* poses. As a gamer who typically enjoys sitting down and battling NPCs all day, *The Last of Us* stands out by making me truly think, by drawing me into its world and making me deeply engaged and intrigued by the complex moral landscape it presents.

# Gameplay:

My first playthrough of *The Last of Us* was on the grounded difficulty, where ammo is scarce, enemies are smarter, resources are limited, and all cool game mechanics (like listening mode) are turned off. These tweaks are designed to make the game more realistic because, in the real world, you wouldn't find magazines filled with bullets lying around. In reality, however, this transformed the survival action game into a horror experience. In the horror genre, the protagonist often faces a threat in a more advantageous position—whether it's Jason in *Friday the 13th* with his unparalleled strength or Freddy Kruger using supernatural abilities to pick off his prey. Similarly, playing as Joel and Ellie on grounded difficulty felt as if I were going against a threat much stronger than myself. Not only did this train me to become the sneakiest and deadliest assassin in the world, but also to be a coward.

I like to consider myself a somewhat *pro-gamer*—give me a gun in a game, and I will be the greatest marksman ever. As such, I enjoy taking out my enemies without getting hit and in the coolest manner possible. Despite this, because my ammo was always so low, I often chose to either take out everyone silently or simply run past my enemies. Grounded difficulty not only rewarded me for killing everyone but also for killing no one—something I rarely consider in an action game. This greatly enhances the survivor world-building. In a world like this, a real person wouldn't go on a killing spree with the skill of John Wick. Instead, they would carefully choose their battles, prioritizing escape to avoid injury and conserve resources. In many ways, the most important aspect of playing grounded is resource management, knowing when and how to use certain items.

Guns feel pretty good in this game, the Naughty Dog aiming mechanics are decent but can be further improved. Fighting melee in this game is also decent but the inclusion of a dodging or blocking aspect would help greatly. In many instances, I initiate a punch on an attacker, only to have them dodge and then knock my character to the ground. This can be incredibly frustrating because the player isn't rewarded for engaging in a fight they might easily win in other games.

Checkpoints in grounded mode are very sparse, and reaching one felt nothing short of pure bliss, especially since I often tried to avoid using resources, saving them for situations where they were truly needed.

Before wrapping up, I want to reflect on a particular moment in the University chapter. Joel accidentally arrives in a dorm filled with clickers and one bloater (types of infected). The Bloater is a tank-like zombie, capable of absorbing nearly everything except fire, and if he gets too close, it's game over. Since the dorm was so cramped, I had to silently navigate past the clickers (who are blind but possess super hearing). As I spot the exit, I realize that the bloater is guarding it. Knowing the bloater is also blind, I carefully sneak past him and get close to the exit, only to find that Joel needs to remove an obstacle—a task that will make a lot of noise—in order to slip through.

Wanting to conserve my resources, I throw a glass bottle to distract the bloater and clickers, then follow up with a Molotov cocktail to set the bloater on fire temporarily. In that brief window, I frantically attempt to remove the obstacle while noticing the bloater charging toward me in the background. I spam the square button to clear the path, and just as the bloater reaches out to grab me, I make my escape.

The thrill I experienced by simply avoiding the bloater was definitely one of the highlights of the game. This is where grounded mode in The Last of Us truly shines—it brings me a sense of happiness from being a resourceful coward.
